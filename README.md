# Clash‑Lite (demo)

This is a small single‑page demo inspired by Clash Royale. It's *not* a full clone — it's a compact example you can host on GitHub Pages.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — simple styling
- `script.js` — game logic (plain JS + canvas)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Clone the repo or unzip the package.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.
3. To publish on GitHub: make a repository, push files, enable GitHub Pages (branch `main` or `gh-pages`).

## Notes & ideas for extension
- Improve elixir regeneration, balancing, unit abilities.
- Add animations, sound.
- Add multiplayer using a server (WebSocket) for real-time play.
- Replace the simple AI with wave scripting.

This project is released as-is for learning and prototyping.
